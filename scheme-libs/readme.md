This directory contains libraries necessary for building and running
unison programs via Racket Scheme.

**Prerequisites**

You'll need to have a couple things installed on your system: 

* [libcrypto](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) (you probably already have this installed)
* [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/), with the executable `racket` on your path somewhere
* [BLAKE2](https://github.com/BLAKE2/libb2) (you may need to install this manually) 

To run the test suite, first `stack build` (or `stack build --fast`), then:

```
./unison-src/builtin-tests/jit-tests.sh
```

OR if you want to run the same tests in interpreted mode:

```
./unison-src/builtin-tests/interpreter-tests.sh
```

The above scripts fetch and cache a copy of base and the scheme-generating libraries, and copy this directory to `$XDG_DATA_DIRECTORY/unisonlanguage/scheme-libs`.

## Iterating more quickly

If running the above transcripts is too slow for you, here's a few things you can do instead:

### Run without needing to bounce ucm

First, tell UCM to load scheme files from this directory, by adding 
a `SchemeLibs.Static` item to your `~/.unisonConfig`. 

```
SchemeLibs.Static = "/path/to/unisoncode"
```

With this set, the compiler commands will look in `/path/to/somewhere/scheme-libs/` for the subdirectories containing the library files. 

Once that's done, you can load the testing library and tests:

```
.jit> load unison-src/builtin-tests/testlib.u
.jit> add
.jit> load unison-src/builtin-tests/tests.u
.jit> add
```

And then, without needing to bounce `ucm` every time you edit your scheme files, you can do:

```
.jit> run.native tests 
```

### Run without needing to regenerate the scheme

`run.native` produces a scheme file in `$XDG_CACHE_DIRECTORY/unisonlanguage/scheme-tmp`, so going one step further, you can grab these files and run them directly using Racket, bypassing `ucm` entirely. 

```
~/unison Â» ls ~/.cache/unisonlanguage/scheme-tmp 
testSuite.scm tests.scm
```

When running `tests.scm` directly with Racket, you'll need to add this `scheme-libs` directory and the generated builtins library to the path. 

```
racket -S ~/.cache/unisonlanguage/scheme-libs/ -S ~/.local/share/unisonlanguage/scheme-libs/racket/ -S ~/.local/share/unisonlanguage/scheme-libs/common/  ~/.cache/unisonlanguage/scheme-tmp/tests.scm
```

-- | Generate a completion tree from a set of names.
-- A completion tree is a suffix tree over the path segments of each name it contains.
-- The goal is to allow fast completion of names by any partial path suffix.
--
-- The tree is generated by building a trie where all possible suffixes of a name are
-- reachable from the root of the trie, with sharing over subtrees to improve memory
-- residency.
--
-- Currently we don't "summarize" all of the children of a node in the node itself, and
-- instead you have to crawl all the children to get the actual completions.
--
-- TODO: Would it be worthwhile to perform compression or include child summaries on the suffix tree?
-- I suspect most namespace trees won't actually compress very well since each node is likely
-- to have terms/types at it.
--
-- E.g. From the names:
-- * alpha.beta.Nat
-- * alpha.Text
-- * foxtrot.Text
--
-- It will generate a tree like the following, where each bullet is a possible completion:
--
-- .
-- ├── foxtrot
-- │   └── Text
-- │       └── * foxtrot.Text (##Text)
-- ├── beta
-- │   └── Nat
-- │       └── * alpha.beta.Nat (##Nat)

-- │   ├── beta

-- │   │       └── * alpha.beta.Nat (##Nat)

-- │       └── * alpha.Text (##Text)

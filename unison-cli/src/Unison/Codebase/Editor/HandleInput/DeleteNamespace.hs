-- How I might do it (is this any better than the current algorithm?)
--
-- 1. Get all direct dependents of the deleted things in the current namespace.
-- 2. For each direct dependent, check a Names built from the deleted namespace â€“ is it there? If not it's the last
--    name.

-- | Goal: When deleting, we might be removing the last name of a given definition (i.e. the
-- definition is going "extinct"). In this case we may wish to take some action or warn the
-- user about these "endangered" definitions which would now contain unnamed references.
-- The argument `otherDesiredDeletions` is included in this function because the user might want to
-- delete a term and all its dependencies in one command, so we give this function access to
-- the full set of entities that the user wishes to delete.

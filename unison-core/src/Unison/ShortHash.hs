-- Arya created this type to be able to query the Codebase for anonymous definitions.  The parsing functions can't fail,
-- because they only try to pull apart the syntactic elements "#" and ".".  They don't necessarily produce a meaningful
-- reference; you'll figure that out during base32 decoding.  We don't attempt base32 decoding here because the base32
-- prefix doesn't correspond to anything useful.  We'll just compare strings against the codebase or namespace later.
-- None of the punctuation is stored here.

-- Parse a string like those described in Referent.fromText:
-- examples:
-- `##Text.take` — builtins don’t have cycles or cids
-- `#2tWjVAuc7` — term ref, no cycle
-- `#y9ycWkiC1.y9` — term ref, part of cycle
-- `#cWkiC1x89#1` — constructor
-- `#DCxrnCAPS.WD#0` — constructor of a type in a cycle
-- A constructor ID on a builtin is ignored:
--  e.g. ##FileIO#2 is parsed as ##FileIO
-- Anything to the left of the first # is
--   e.g. foo#abc is parsed as #abc
-- Anything including and following a third # is ignored.
--   e.g. foo#abc#2#hello is parsed as #abc#2
-- Anything after a second . before a second # is ignored.
--   e.g. foo#abc.1f.x is parsed as #abc.1f

-- because they only try to pull apart the syntactic elements "#" and ".".  They don't necessarily produce a meaningful
-- reference; you'll figure that out during base32 decoding.  We don't attempt base32 decoding here because the base32
-- prefix doesn't correspond to anything useful.  We'll just compare strings against the codebase or namespace later.
-- None of the punctuation is stored here.

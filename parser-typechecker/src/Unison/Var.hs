-- | A class for variables. Variables may have auxiliary information which
-- may not form part of their identity according to `Eq` / `Ord`. Laws:
--
--   * `name (named n) == n`:
--     `name` returns the name set by `named`.
--   * `Set.notMember (freshIn vs v) vs`:
--     `freshIn` returns a variable not used in the `Set`
--   * `name (freshIn vs v) == name v`:
--     `freshIn` does not alter the name
--   * `Set.notMember (qualifiedName $ freshIn vs v) (Set.map qualifiedName vs)`:
--     `qualifiedName` incorporates all additional id info from freshening into
--     the name of the variable.
--   * `clear (freshIn vs v) === clear (freshIn vs (named (name v)))`:
--     `clear` strips any auxiliary information and returns a variable that behaves
--     as if it has been built solely via calls to `named` and `freshIn`. The `===`
--     is full equality, comparing any auxiliary info as well as qualified name.
--   * `clear v == v`, according to Haskell equality. In other words, no auxiliary
--     info attached to `v` values may participate in the `Eq` or `Ord` instances,
--     it is 'just' metadata.

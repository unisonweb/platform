-- | A "pin board" is a place to pin values; semantically, it's a set, but differs in a few ways:
--
--   * Pinned values aren't kept alive by the pin board, they might be garbage collected at any time.
--   * If you try to pin a value that's already pinned (per its Eq instance), the pinned one will be returned
--     instead.
--   * It has a small API: just 'new' and 'pin'.

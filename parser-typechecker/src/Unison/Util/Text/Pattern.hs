-- Wrapper type. Holds a pattern together with its compilation. This is used as
-- the semantic value of a unison `Pattern a`. Laziness avoids building the
-- matcher until it actually needs to be used, and also avoids recalculating the
-- match function if a `CPattern` is 'run' multiple times, while allowing the
-- builtin runner to just take two arguments, and not try to build a partial
-- application by hand.
--
-- In the future, this can existentially quantify over the type being matched.

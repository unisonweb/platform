`Causal a` has 5 operations, specified algebraically here:

* `before : Causal m a -> Causal m a -> m Bool` defines a partial order on
            `Causal`.
* `head : Causal m a -> a`, which represents the "latest" `a` value in a causal
          chain.
* `one : a -> Causal m a`, satisfying `head (one hd) == hd`
* `cons : a -> Causal a -> Causal a`, satisfying `head (cons hd tl) == hd` and
          also `before tl (cons hd tl)`.
* `merge : CommutativeSemigroup a => Causal a -> Causal a -> Causal a`, which is
           associative and commutative and satisfies:
  * `before c1 (merge c1 c2)`
  * `before c2 (merge c1 c2)`
* `sequence : Causal a -> Causal a -> Causal a`, which is defined as
              `sequence c1 c2 = cons (head c2) (merge c1 c2)`.
  * `before c1 (sequence c1 c2)`
  * `head (sequence c1 c2) == head c2`

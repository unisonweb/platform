`Causal a` has 5 operations, specified algebraically here:

\* `before : Causal m a -> Causal m a -> m Bool` defines a partial order on
            `Causal`.
\* `head : Causal m a -> a`, which represents the "latest" `a` value in a causal
          chain.
\* `one : a -> Causal m a`, satisfying `head (one hd) == hd`
\* `cons : a -> Causal a -> Causal a`, satisfying `head (cons hd tl) == hd` and
          also `before tl (cons hd tl)`.
\* `merge : CommutativeSemigroup a => Causal a -> Causal a -> Causal a`, which is
           commutative (but not associative) and satisfies:
  * `before c1 (merge c1 c2)`
  * `before c2 (merge c1 c2)`
\* `sequence : Causal a -> Causal a -> Causal a`, which is defined as
              `sequence c1 c2 = cons (head c2) (merge c1 c2)`.
  * `before c1 (sequence c1 c2)`
  * `head (sequence c1 c2) == head c2`

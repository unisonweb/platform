-- | Pattern match coverage checking is implemented following the
-- algorithm described in [Lower Your
-- Guards](https://simon.peytonjones.org/assets/pdfs/lower-your-guards.pdf). The
-- goal of pattern match coverage checking is to identify the
-- following problems that may arise in a pattern match:
--
-- * It is missing clauses (/i.e./ it is non-exhaustive)
-- * It contains redundant patterns (/i.e./ the case can be deleted without altering the program)
-- * It contains inaccessible patterns (/i.e/ the rhs can never be entered)
--
-- Furthermore, in the case of a non-exhaustive match, the goal to
-- present the user with concrete values that do not match any of the
-- existing patterns.
--
-- /N.B./ An inaccessible pattern in unison would be one that performs
-- effects in a guard although the constraints are unsatisfiable. Such
-- a pattern cannot be deleted without altering the program.
--
-- == High-level algorithm overview
--
-- 1. [Desugar]("Unison.PatternMatchCoverage.Desugar") a match expression into a 'Unison.PatternMatchCoverage.GrdTree.GrdTree'.
-- 2. Annotate the @GrdTree@ leaves with [refinement types]("Unison.PatternMatchCoverage.NormalizedConstraints")
-- describing values that match this branch. Redundant and inaccessible patterns are then identified by @GrdTree@ leaves
-- with uninhabited refinement types. Inaccessible patterns are distinguished by an effect being performed between the
-- @GrdTree@ root and the leaf.
-- 3. Traverse the @GrdTree@ building up a refinement type describing uncovered values. If the resulting refinement type
-- is inhabited then the match is missing clauses.
-- 4. Find inhabitants of the uncovered refinement type to present to the user.
--
-- Step (1) is implemented by 'desugarMatch'. Steps (2) and (3) are
-- implemented as a single traversal: 'uncoverAnnotate'/'classify'. Step (4) is
-- implemented by 'expandSolution'/'generateInhabitants'.

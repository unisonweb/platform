-- | Order bindings by dependencies and group into components.
-- Each component consists of > 1 bindings, each of which depends
-- transitively on all other bindings in the component.
--
-- 1-element components may or may not depend on themselves.
--
-- The order is such that a component at index i will not depend
-- on components and indexes > i. But a component at index i does not
-- _necessarily_ depend on any components at earlier indices.
--
-- Example:
--
--   let rec
--     ping n = pong (n + 1);
--     pong n = ping (n + 1);
--     g = id 42;
--     y = id "hi"
--     id x = x;
--   in ping g
--
-- `components` would produce `[[ping,pong], [id], [g], [y]]`
-- Notice that `id` comes before `g` and `y` in the output, since
-- both `g` and `y` depend on `id`.

-- Uses Tarjan's algorithm:

-- | Algorithm for minimizing cycles of a `let rec`. This can
-- improve generalization during typechecking and may also be more
-- efficient for execution.
--
-- For instance:
--
-- minimize (let rec id x = x; g = id 42; y = id "hi" in g)
-- ==>
-- Just (let id x = x; g = id 42; y = id "hi" in g)
--
-- Gets rid of the let rec and replaces it with an ordinary `let`, such
-- that `id` is suitably generalized.

The runtime tests are hosted at https://share.unison-lang.org/@unison/runtime-tests/

If you want to add or update tests, you can create a branch of that project, and update the `runtime_tests_version` line in `jit-tests.sh` and `CI.yaml`

Before merging the PR on Github, we'll merge your branch on Share and restore `runtime_tests_version` to /main or maybe a release.

``` ucm
runtime-tests/selected> run tests

  ()

runtime-tests/selected> run tests.interpreter.only

  ()

```

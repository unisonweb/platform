Tests some capabilities for catching runtime exceptions.

```unison
catcher : '{IO} () ->{IO} Result
catcher act =
  handle tryEval act with cases
    { raise _ -> _ } -> Ok "caught"
    { _ } -> Fail "nothing to catch"

tests _ =
  [ catcher do
      _ = 1/0
      ()
  , catcher '(bug "testing")
  , handle tryEval (do 1+1) with cases
      { raise _ -> _ } -> Fail "1+1 failed"
      { 2 } -> Ok "got the right answer"
      { _ } -> Fail "got the wrong answer"
  ]
```

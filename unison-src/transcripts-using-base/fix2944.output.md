This bugfix reduces "\_eta" expanded terms from the decompiler
before pretty-printing.

``` unison
ability Foo where
  foo : Nat -> Nat
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm
  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      ability Foo
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    ability Foo
```

```` unison
bar = {{
  @typecheck```
  0 |> foo |> foo
  ```
}}
````

  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      bar : Doc2
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> display bar

      0 |> foo |> foo
```

Previously would get rendered as:

``` 
0 |> (_eta -> foo _eta) |> (_eta -> foo _eta)
```

But should be:

``` 
0 |> foo |> foo
```

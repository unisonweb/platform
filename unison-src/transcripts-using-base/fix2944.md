This bugfix reduces "_eta" expanded terms from the decompiler
before pretty-printing.

```unison
ability Foo where
  foo : Nat -> Nat
```

```ucm
scratch/main> add
```

````unison
bar = {{
  @typecheck```
  0 |> foo |> foo
  ```
}}
````

``` ucm
scratch/main> display bar
```

Previously would get rendered as:

```
0 |> (_eta -> foo _eta) |> (_eta -> foo _eta)
```

But should be:

```
0 |> foo |> foo
```

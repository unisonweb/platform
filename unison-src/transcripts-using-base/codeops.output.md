Test for code serialization operations.

Define a function, serialize it, then deserialize it back to an actual
function. Also ask for its dependencies for display later.

```
This simply runs some functions to make sure there isn't a crash. Once
we gain the ability to capture output in a transcript, it can be modified
to actual show that the serialization works.

# tests for io2.MVar

`MVar`s are mutable, sharable storage for a single value, which may or
may not be present at any given time. It is sharable in the sense that
it is safe for multiple threads to attempt simultaneous reading and
writing to and from the same MVar safely.

MVars are the building block on which many other concurrency
primitives can be built, such as Futures, Run at most once initializer
blocks, Queues, etc.

When running a main function in `ucm` a numeric argument is replaced by the potential last result of a find command:

``` unison
main : '{IO, Exception} ()
main _ =
  printLine ("Hello " ++ Optional.getOrBug "definitely passed an arg" (List.head !getArgs) ++ "!")
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm
  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      main : '{IO, Exception} ()
```

First we run it with no numbered results in the history, so if number expansion is applied, it should end up calling `main` with zero args, whereas without number expansion, we get a single argument, “1”, passed to it.

``` ucm :bug
scratch/main> run main 1

  💔💥

  I've encountered a call to builtin.bug with the following
  value:

    "definitely passed an arg"

  Stack trace:
    bug
    main
    #ra2ebfober
```

Now we set it up so there *are* numbered results in the history. If number expansion is applied here, we will get an error “`run` can’t accept a numbered argument \[…\]”, and otherwise our expected "1".

``` ucm :bug
scratch/main> find.all isLeft

  1. Either.isLeft : Either a b -> Boolean

scratch/main> run main 1

  ⚠️

  Sorry, I wasn’t sure how to process your request:

    `run` can’t accept a numbered argument for a command-line
    argument and it’s not yet possible to provide un-expanded
    numbers as arguments.

  You can run `help run` for more information on using `run`.
```

When running a main function in `ucm` a numeric argument is replaced by the potential last result of a find command:

``` unison
main : '{IO, Exception} ()
main _ =
  printLine ("Hello " ++ Optional.getOrBug "definitely passed an arg" (List.head !getArgs) ++ "!")
```

First we run it with no numbered results in the history, so if number expansion is applied, it should end up calling `main` with zero args, whereas without number expansion, we get a single argument, “1”, passed to it.

``` ucm
scratch/main> run main 1
```

Now we set it up so there _are_ numbered results in the history. If number expansion is applied here, we will get an error “`run` can’t accept a numbered argument […]”, and otherwise our expected "1".

``` ucm
scratch/main> find.all isLeft
scratch/main> run main 1
```

use . Int -- imports `.Int` from root path and gives it the local name `Int`

-- This brings `None` into scope unqualified
use Optional None

-- '.' is optional, this brings `None` and `Some` into
-- scope unqualified
use Optional None Some

-- Can import operators this way also
-- no need to put them in parens
use Nat +

-- Later imports shadow earlier ones
use Nat - * /
use Nat drop *
use Nat drop
-- use Int + -- this would cause type error below!

> match Some (100 + 200 / 3 * 2) with
    Optional.None -> 19
    Some _ -> 20

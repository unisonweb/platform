This transcript verifies that the pretty-printer produces code that can be successfully parsed, for a variety of examples. Terms or types that fail to round-trip can be added here as regression tests. Add tests at the bottom of this

## How to use this transcript: checking round-trip for inline definitions

```unison
x = 1 + 1
```

```ucm
.> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    x : Nat

.> edit x

  ☝️
  
  I added these definitions to the top of
  /Users/runar/work/unison/scratch.u
  
    x : Nat
    x =
      use Nat +
      1 + 1
  
  You can edit them there, then do `update` to replace the
  definitions currently in this namespace.

  Here is a log of the root namespace hashes, starting with the
  most recent, along with the command that got us there. Try:
  
    `fork 2 .old`             
    `fork #l7cnk7raag .old`   to make an old namespace
                              accessible again,
                              
    `reset-root #l7cnk7raag`  to reset the root namespace and
                              its history to that of the
                              specified namespace.

```
Resetting the namespace after each example ensures they don't interact at all, which is probably what you want.

The `load` command which does parsing and typechecking of the `edit`'d definitions needs to be in a separate stanza from the `edit` command.

```ucm
.> load scratch.u

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      x : Nat

```
## How to use this transcript: checking round-trip for definitions from a file

Examples can also be loaded from `.u` files:

```ucm
.> load unison-src/transcripts-round-trip/ex2.u

  I found and typechecked these definitions in
  unison-src/transcripts-round-trip/ex2.u. If you do an `add` or
  `update`, here's how your codebase would change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      b : Nat

.> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    b : Nat

```
When loading definitions from a file, an empty stanza like this will ensure that this empty file is where the definitions being `edit`'d will get dumped.

```unison
-- empty scratch file, `edit` will target this
```

Without the above stanza, the `edit` will send the definition to the most recently loaded file, which would be `ex2.u`, making the transcript not idempotent.

```ucm
.> edit b

  ☝️
  
  I added these definitions to the top of
  /Users/runar/work/unison/scratch.u
  
    b : Nat
    b = 92384
  
  You can edit them there, then do `update` to replace the
  definitions currently in this namespace.

```
No reason you can't load a bunch of definitions from a single `.u` file in one go, the only thing that's annoying is you'll have to `find` and then `edit 1-11` in the transcript to load all the definitions into the file.

## Delayed computations passed to a function as the last argument

When a delayed computation block is passed to a function as the last argument
in a context where the ambient precedence is low enough, we can elide parentheses
around it and use a "soft hang" to put the `'let` on the same line as the function call.
This looks nice.

    forkAt usEast do
      x = thing1
      y = thing2
      ...

vs the not as pretty but still correct:

    forkAt
      usEast
      (do
          x = thing1
          y = thing2
          ...)

# Lambda as the last argument where the bound var is not free in the body

If a lambda's argument is not free in the body, the term printer counts this as
a "delay" instead of a lambda. This test makes sure that detecting this
condition lines up with the printing, so we don't detect a delay but then
go ahead and print it as a normal lambda.

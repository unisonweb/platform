-- as of commit a48fa3b, we get the following error

    --The expression at Line 18, columns 40-41 (in red below) is requesting
    --    {𝛆3} abilitys, but this location only has access to
    --    {}
    --
    --   18 |   Optional.Some a1 -> reduce (f a0 a1) f (drop 1 s)
    --                                               ^
    --  simple cause:
    --    AbilityCheckFailure: ambient={} requested={𝛆3}

-- The problem is that I've accidentally called `reduce` instead of `reduce2`,
-- which TDNRs to `Stream.reduce`, which doesn't allow abilitys, and `f` isn't
-- restricted to be pure.

-- I'd like to know:
--  a) reduce is the built-in
--        Stream.reduce : a -> (a ->{} a ->{} a) -> Stream a -> a
--  b) maybe those suggestions, like did you mean reduce2 instead of reduce,
--     which would typecheck.  I understand that would not be a quick fix.

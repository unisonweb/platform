# Suffix-based resolution of names

Any unique name suffix can be used to refer to a definition. For instance:

```unison
-- No imports needed even though FQN is `builtin.{Int,Nat}`
foo.bar.a : Int
foo.bar.a = +99

-- No imports needed even though FQN is `builtin.Optional.{None,Some}`
optional.isNone = cases
  None -> true
  Some _ -> false
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      foo.bar.a       : Int
      optional.isNone : Optional a -> Boolean
   
  Now evaluating any watch expressions (lines starting with
  `>`)... Ctrl+C cancels.

```
This also affects commands like find. Notice lack of qualified names in output:

```ucm
.> find take

  1. builtin.Bytes.take : Nat -> Bytes -> Bytes
  2. builtin.List.take : Nat -> [a] -> [a]
  3. builtin.Text.take : Nat -> Text -> Text
  

```
In the signature, we don't see `base.Nat`, just `Nat`. The full declaration name is still shown for each search result though.

Type-based search also benefits from this, we can just say `Nat` rather than `.base.Nat`:

```ucm
.> find : Nat -> [a] -> [a]

  1. builtin.List.drop : Nat -> [a] -> [a]
  2. builtin.List.take : Nat -> [a] -> [a]
  

```

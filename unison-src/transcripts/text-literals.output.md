This transcript shows some syntax for raw text literals.

```unison
lit1 = """
This is a raw text literal.
It can start with 3 or more ",
and is terminated by the same number of quotes.
Nothing is escaped. \n

The initial newline, if it exists, is ignored.
"""

> lit1
> Some lit1

lit2 = """"
    This is a raw text literal, indented.
    It can start with 3 or more ",
    and is terminated by the same number of quotes.
    Nothing is escaped. \n

    This doesn't terminate the literal - """
    """"

> lit2
> Some lit2
```

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      lit1 : Text
      lit2 : Text
  
  Now evaluating any watch expressions (lines starting with
  `>`)... Ctrl+C cancels.

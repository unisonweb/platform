```unison

Bug: we want this update to be rejected earlier, because it violates the "decl coherency" precondition that there's
only one name for each constructor. We instead get too far in the update process, and are delivered a bogus scratch.u
file to stare at.

```ucm:error
scratch/main> update
```

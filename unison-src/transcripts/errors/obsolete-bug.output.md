This transcript will error, because weâ€™re claiming that the stanza has a bug, but `help` works as expected.

``` ucm :bug
scratch/main> help edit

  edit
  `edit foo` prepends the definition of `foo` to the top of the most recently saved file.
  `edit` without arguments invokes a search to select a definition for editing, which requires that `fzf` can be found within your PATH.
```

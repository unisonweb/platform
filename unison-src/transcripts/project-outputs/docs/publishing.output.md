# Publishing Unison code

Thinking about a design for publishing Unison code revealed a nest of interrelated concerns:

  - [Using library code in my application & sharing my application as a library](publishing-library1.md)
  - [Updating my library & sharing an updated library](publishing-library2.md)

<!-- * [Upgrading my application with an updated library](publishing-library3.md) -->

Each of these linked subtopics presents concerns, questions, and ideas, which we can weigh and collect into [our M1 proposal](publishing-M1.md).

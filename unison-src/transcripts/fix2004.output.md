Here's the scenario that can produce bad empty namespace LCAs:

```deletes
of v4
j1: ... - v1 - v2 - v3 - v4 - v4a - v5 - v6 - v7
                                              /
                                  <empty> - v5a

                               adds of unrelated
j2: ... - v1 - v2 - v3 - v4 - x0 - x1 - x2 - x3
                                            /
                                <empty> - z1


```

So `j1` and `j2` have common history up through `v4`, then `j1` deletes some definitions while `j2` adds some definitions via shallow merges. These shallow merges then result in the LCA being the empty namespace rather than `v4`.

First, we create some common history before a fork:

```ucm
  ☝️  The namespace .a is empty.

.a> alias.term .builtin.Nat.+ delete1

  Done.

.a> alias.term .builtin.Nat.* delete2

  Done.

.a> alias.term .builtin.Nat.drop delete3

  Done.

.a> alias.type .builtin.Nat Delete4

  Done.

```
Now we fork `a2` off of `a`. `a` continues on, deleting the terms it added previously and then adding one unrelated term via a merge with little history. It's this short history merge which will become a bad LCA of the empty namespace.

```ucm
.> fork a a2

  Done.

.a> delete.term.verbose delete1

  Name changes:
  
    Original            Changes
    1. a.delete1     ┐  2. a.delete1 (removed)
    3. a2.delete1    │  
    4. builtin.Nat.+ ┘  
  
  Tip: You can use `undo` or `reflog` to undo this change.

.a> delete.term.verbose delete2

  Name changes:
  
    Original            Changes
    1. a.delete2     ┐  2. a.delete2 (removed)
    3. a2.delete2    │  
    4. builtin.Nat.* ┘  
  
  Tip: You can use `undo` or `reflog` to undo this change.

.a> delete.term.verbose delete3

  Name changes:
  
    Original               Changes
    1. a.delete3        ┐  2. a.delete3 (removed)
    3. a2.delete3       │  
    4. builtin.Nat.drop ┘  
  
  Tip: You can use `undo` or `reflog` to undo this change.

.a> delete.type.verbose Delete4

  Name changes:
  
    Original          Changes
    1. a.Delete4   ┐  2. a.Delete4 (removed)
    3. a2.Delete4  │  
    4. builtin.Nat ┘  
  
  Tip: You can use `undo` or `reflog` to undo this change.

  ☝️  The namespace .newbranchA is empty.

.newbranchA> alias.term .builtin.Float.+ dontDelete

  Done.

.> merge newbranchA a

  Here's what's changed in a after the merge:
  
  Added definitions:
  
    1. dontDelete : Float -> Float -> Float
  
  Tip: You can use `todo` to see if this generated any work to
       do in this namespace and `test` to run the tests. Or you
       can use `undo` or `reflog` to undo the results of this
       merge.

.a> find

  1. dontDelete : Float -> Float -> Float
  

```
Meanwhile, `a2` adds some other unrelated terms, some via merging in namespaces with little history. When merging `a2` back into `a`, the deletes from their common history should be respected.

```ucm
.a2> alias.term .builtin.Text.take keep1

  Done.

.a2> alias.term .builtin.Text.take keep2

  Done.

.a2> alias.term .builtin.Text.take keep3

  Done.

.a2> alias.term .builtin.Text.take keep4

  Done.

.a2> alias.term .builtin.Text.take keep5

  Done.

  ☝️  The namespace .newbranchA2 is empty.

.newbranchA2> alias.term .builtin.Text.take keep6

  Done.

.> merge newbranchA2 a2

  Here's what's changed in a2 after the merge:
  
  Name changes:
  
    Original    Changes
    1. keep1 ┐  2. keep6 (added)
    3. keep2 │

At this point, all the things that `a` has deleted (`delete1`, `delete2`, etc) should be deleted in both the merged and squashed results. Let's verify this:

```ucm
.a> find

  1. dontDelete : Float -> Float -> Float
  2. keep1 : Delete4 -> Text -> Text
  3. keep2 : Delete4 -> Text -> Text
  4. keep3 : Delete4 -> Text -> Text
  5. keep4 : Delete4 -> Text -> Text
  6. keep5 : Delete4 -> Text -> Text
  7. keep6 : Delete4 -> Text -> Text
  

.asquash> find

  1. dontDelete : Float -> Float -> Float
  2. keep1 : Delete4 -> Text -> Text
  3. keep2 : Delete4 -> Text -> Text
  4. keep3 : Delete4 -> Text -> Text
  5. keep4 : Delete4 -> Text -> Text
  6. keep5 : Delete4 -> Text -> Text
  7. keep6 : Delete4 -> Text -> Text
  

```
```ucm

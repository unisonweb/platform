  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      allowDebug : Text
      bool       : Boolean
      debug      : a -> Text
      t1         : [Result]
  
  Now evaluating any watch expressions (lines starting with
  `>`)... Ctrl+C cancels.

    6 | test> t1 = if bool then [Ok "Yay"] 
    
    ✅ Passed Yay

```
```ucm
.> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    allowDebug : Text
    bool       : Boolean
    debug      : a -> Text
    t1         : [Result]

  ◉ t1   Yay
  
  ✅ 1 test(s) passing
  
  Tip: Use view t1 to view the source of a test.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your
      new definition:
    
      bool : Boolean

```
```ucm
.> update

  Okay, I'm searching the branch for code that needs to be
  updated...

  That's done. Now I'm making sure everything typechecks...

  Everything typechecks, so I'm saving the results...

  Done.

```ucm
scratch/main> builtins.merge
```

First, lets create two namespaces. `foo` and `bar`, and add some definitions.

```unison
foo.x = 42
foo.y = 100
bar.z = x + y
```

```ucm
scratch/main> add
```

Let's see what we have created...

```ucm
scratch/main> ls
```

Now, if we try deleting the namespace `foo`, we get an error, as expected.

```ucm:error
scratch/main> delete.namespace foo
```

Any numbered arguments should refer to `bar.z`.

```ucm
scratch/main> debug.numberedArgs
```

We can then delete the dependent term, and then delete `foo`.

```ucm
scratch/main> delete.term 1
scratch/main> delete.namespace foo
```

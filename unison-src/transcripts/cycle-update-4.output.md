Not yet working: using update to establish a cycle.

```unison
ping : 'Nat
ping _ = 1

pong : 'Nat
pong _ = !ping + 2
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      ping : 'Nat
      pong : 'Nat

```
```ucm
.> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    ping : 'Nat
    pong : 'Nat

```
```unison
ping : 'Nat
ping _ = !pong + 1
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your
      new definition:
    
      ping : 'Nat

```
```ucm
.> update

  ⍟ I've updated these names to your new definition:
  
    ping : 'Nat

.> view ping pong

  ping : 'Nat
  ping _ =
    use Nat +
    !pong + 1
  
  pong : 'Nat
  pong _ =
    use Nat +
    !#tte2bk37hp + 2

```
The bug: `pong` should refer to the new `ping` by name, not the (now nameless) old `ping.

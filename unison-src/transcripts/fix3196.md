Tests ability checking in scenarios where one side is concrete and the other is
a variable. This was supposed to be covered, but the method wasn't actually
symmetric, so doing `equate l r` might work, but not `equate r l`.

Below were cases that caused the failing order.

```unison
structural type W es = W

unique ability Zoot where
  zoot : ()

woot : W {g} -> '{g, Zoot} a ->{Zoot} a
woot w a = todo ()

ex = do
  w = (W : W {Zoot})
  woot w do bug "why don't you typecheck?"

w1 : W {Zoot}
w1 = W

w2 : W {g} -> W {g}
w2 = cases W -> W

> w2 w1
```

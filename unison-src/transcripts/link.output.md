# Linking definitions to metadata

The `link` and `unlink` commands can be used to manage metadata linked to definitions. For example, you can link documentation to a definition:


```unison
use .builtin

coolFunction x = x * 2

coolFunction.doc = [: This is a cool function. :]
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      coolFunction     : Nat -> Nat
      coolFunction.doc : Doc
   
  Now evaluating any watch expressions (lines starting with
  `>`)... Ctrl+C cancels.

```
```ucm
.> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    coolFunction     : Nat -> Nat
    coolFunction.doc : Doc

.> link coolFunction.doc coolFunction

  Updates:
  
    1. coolFunction : Nat -> Nat
       + 2. doc : Doc

```
You can use arbitrary Unison values and link them as metadata to definitions:

```unison
use .builtin 

unique type License = { licenseText : Text }

unique type Author = { authorName : Text }

unique type Year = { toInt : Int }

alice = Author "Alice Coder"

coolFunction.license = licenses.mit (Year +2020) alice

licenses.mit : Year -> Author -> License
licenses.mit year author = 
  License ("Copyright " ++ toText (Year.toInt year) ++ " " ++ authorName author ++ "

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    Author.authorName.modify   : (Text ->{𝕖} Text)

.> link coolFunction.license coolFunction

  Updates:

       + 2. license : License

.> link alice coolFunction

  Updates:
  
    1. coolFunction : Nat -> Nat
       + 2. alice : Author

```
We can look at the links we have:

```ucm
.> links coolFunction

  1. coolFunction.license : License
  2. alice                : Author
  3. coolFunction.doc     : Doc
  
  Tip: Try using `display 1` to display the first result or
       `view 1` to view its source.

```
We can link the same metadata simultaneously to multiple definitions:

```unison
myLibrary.f x = x + 1
myLibrary.g x = x + 2
myLibrary.h x = x + 3
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      myLibrary.f : Nat -> Nat
      myLibrary.g : Nat -> Nat
      myLibrary.h : Nat -> Nat

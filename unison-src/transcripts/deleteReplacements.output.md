# Deleting term and type replacements from patches

```unison

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      x : ##Nat

```
```ucm
.> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    x : ##Nat

```
```unison
x = 2
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your
      new definition:
    
      x : ##Nat

```
```ucm
.> update

  ⍟ I've updated these names to your new definition:
  
    x : ##Nat

.> view.patch

  Edited Terms: 1. x#jk19sm5bf8 -> 2. x
  
  Tip: To remove entries from a patch, use

       appropriate.

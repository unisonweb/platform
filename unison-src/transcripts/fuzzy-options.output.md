# Test that the options selector for fuzzy finding is working as expected for different argument types.

If an argument is required but doesn't have a fuzzy resolver, the command should just print the help.


```ucm
-- The second argument of move.term is a 'new-name' and doesn't have a fuzzy resolver
.> move.term

`move.term foo bar` renames `foo` to `bar`.

```
If a fuzzy resolver doesn't have any options available it should print a message instead of
opening an empty fuzzy-select.

```ucm
  ☝️  The namespace .empty is empty.

.empty> view

⚠️

Sorry, I was expecting an argument for the definition to view, and I couldn't find any to suggest to you. 😓

```
```unison
optionOne = 1

nested.optionTwo = 2
```

Definition args

```ucm
  ☝️  The namespace . is empty.

.> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    nested.optionTwo : ##Nat
    optionOne        : ##Nat

.> debug.fuzzy-options view _

  Select a definition to view:
    * optionOne
    * nested.optionTwo

```
Namespace args

```ucm
.> add

  ⊡ Ignored previously added definitions: nested.optionTwo
    optionOne

.> debug.fuzzy-options cd _

  Select a namespace:
    * nested

```
Project Branch args

```ucm
.> project.create-empty myproject

  🎉 I've created the project myproject.

myproject/main> branch mybranch

  Done. I've created the mybranch branch based off of main.
  
  Tip: Use `merge /mybranch /main` to merge your work back into
       the main branch.

.> debug.fuzzy-options switch _

  Select a project or branch to switch to:
    * myproject/main
    * myproject/mybranch
    * myproject

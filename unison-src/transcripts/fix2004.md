.> builtins.merge
```

Here's the scenario that can produce bad empty namespace LCAs:

```
                              deletes of v4
j1: ... - v1 - v2 - v3 - v4 - v4a - v5 - v6 - v7
                                              /
                                  <empty> - v5a

                               adds of unrelated
j2: ... - v1 - v2 - v3 - v4 - x0 - x1 - x2 - x3
                                            /
                                <empty> - z1

```

So `j1` and `j2` have common history up through `v4`, then `j1` deletes some definitions while `j2` adds some definitions via shallow merges. These shallow merges then result in the LCA being the empty namespace rather than `v4`.

First, we create some common history before a fork:

```ucm
.a> alias.term .builtin.Nat.+ delete1
.a> alias.term .builtin.Nat.* delete2
.a> alias.term .builtin.Nat.drop delete3
.a> alias.type .builtin.Nat Delete4
```

Now we fork `a2` off of `a`. `a` continues on, deleting the terms it added previously and then adding one unrelated term via a merge with little history. It's this short history merge which will become a bad LCA of the empty namespace.

```ucm
.> fork a a2
.a> delete.term.verbose delete1
.a> delete.term.verbose delete2
.a> delete.term.verbose delete3
.a> delete.type.verbose Delete4
.newbranchA> alias.term .builtin.Float.+ dontDelete
.> merge newbranchA a
.a> find
```

Meanwhile, `a2` adds some other unrelated terms, some via merging in namespaces with little history. When merging `a2` back into `a`, the deletes from their common history should be respected.

```ucm
.a2> alias.term .builtin.Text.take keep1
.a2> alias.term .builtin.Text.take keep2
.a2> alias.term .builtin.Text.take keep3
.a2> alias.term .builtin.Text.take keep4
.a2> alias.term .builtin.Text.take keep5
.newbranchA2> alias.term .builtin.Text.take keep6
.> merge newbranchA2 a2
.a2> find
```

```ucm
.> fork a asquash
.> merge a2 a
.> squash a2 asquash
```

At this point, all the things that `a` has deleted (`delete1`, `delete2`, etc) should be deleted in both the merged and squashed results. Let's verify this:

```ucm
.a> find
.asquash> find
```

```ucm:hide
.> view a.keep1 a.keep2 a.keep3
.> view asquash.keep1 asquash.keep2 asquash.keep3
```

```ucm:error
.> view a.Delete4
```

```ucm:error
.> view asquash.delete1
```

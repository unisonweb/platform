You can use a keyword or reserved operator as a name segment if you surround it with backticks.

```ucm:error
scratch/main> view `match`
scratch/main> view `=`
```

You can also use backticks to expand the set of valid symbols in a symboly name segment to include these three: `.()`

This allows you to spell `.` or `()` as name segments (which historically have appeared in the namespace).

```ucm:error
scratch/main> view `.`
scratch/main> view `()`
```

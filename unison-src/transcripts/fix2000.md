Checks that squash and merge do the same thing, with nontrivial history that
includes a merge conflict.

```ucm:hide
.> builtins.merge
```

```unison
x.a.p = "af"
x.a.q = "ef"
```

```ucm
.> add
.> fork x y
.> fork x s
.> fork x m
.> delete.verbose y.a.p
```

```unison
y.a.p = "fij"
```

```ucm
.> add
```

```unison
y.b.p = "wie"
```

Merge back into the ancestor.

```ucm
.> add
.> merge y.b y.a
.> delete.term.verbose 1
.> merge y m
.> squash y s
.s> todo
.m> todo
```

We were seeing an issue where (it seemed) that every namespace that was visited during a propagate would get a new history node, even when it didn't contain any dependents.

Example:
```unison:hide
a = "a term"
X.foo = "a namespace"
```

```ucm
scratch/main> add
```

Here is an update which should not affect `X`:
```unison:hide
a = "an update"
```
```ucm
scratch/main> update
```

As of the time of this writing, the history for `X` should be a single node, `#4eeuo5bsfr`;
```ucm
scratch/main> history X
```
however, as of release/M1i, we saw an extraneous node appear.  If your `ucm` is fixed, you won't see it below:
```ucm:error
scratch/main> history #7nl6ppokhg
```

# Linking definitions to metadata

The `link` and `unlink` commands can be used to manage metadata linked to definitions. For example, you can link documentation to a definition:


```unison
use .builtin

coolFunction x = x * 2

coolFunction.doc = [: This is a cool function. :]
```

```ucm
.> add
.> link coolFunction.doc coolFunction
```

You can use arbitrary Unison values and link them as metadata to definitions:

```unison
use .builtin 

unique type License = { licenseText : Text }

unique type Author = { authorName : Text }

unique type Year = { toInt : Int }

alice = Author "Alice Coder"

coolFunction.license = licenses.mit (Year +2020) alice

licenses.mit : Year -> Author -> License
licenses.mit year author = 
  License ("Copyright " ++ toText (Year.toInt year) ++ " " ++ authorName author ++ "

```

```ucm
.> add
.> link coolFunction.license coolFunction
.> link alice coolFunction
```

We can look at the links we have:

```ucm
.> links coolFunction
```

We can link the same metadata simultaneously to multiple definitions:

```unison
myLibrary.f x = x + 1
myLibrary.g x = x + 2
myLibrary.h x = x + 3
```

```ucm
.> add
.> cd myLibrary
.myLibrary> find
.myLibrary> link .alice 1-3
.myLibrary> links f
.myLibrary> links g
.myLibrary> links h
.myLibrary> history
```

Check that `Value.value` works in watch expressions:

``` unison
toText' : a -> Text
toText' a = match Debug.toText a with
    None -> bug ("no name available", a)
    Some (Left t) -> t
    Some (Right t) -> t

test> foo.test =
  x = 192
  v = Value.value 192
  [Ok (toText' v)]
```

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      foo.test : [Result]
      toText'  : a -> Text

  Now evaluating any watch expressions (lines starting with
  `>`)... Ctrl+C cancels.

    8 |   x = 192
    
    ✅ Passed bug "<Value>"
```

``` ucm
fresh/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    foo.test : [Result]
    toText'  : a -> Text

fresh/main> test

  Cached test results (`help testcache` to learn more)

    1. foo.test   ◉ bug "<Value>"

  ✅ 1 test(s) passing

  Tip: Use view 1 to view the source of a test.
```

Check that it works in tests that are never executed as watch expressions. See [this
issue](https://github.com/unisonweb/unison/issues/4685) for motivation.

``` unison
bar.test : [Test.Result]
bar.test =
  v = Value.value 42
  [Ok (toText' v)]

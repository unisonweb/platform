  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      bar.baz : Nat
      foo     : Nat
      qux     : Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    bar.baz : Nat
    foo     : Nat
    qux     : Nat
```

``` unison
foo : Nat
foo =
  baz = bar.baz + bar.baz
  20

bar.baz : Nat
bar.baz = 20
```

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⊡ Previously added definitions will be ignored: bar.baz
    
    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your
      new definition:
    
      foo : Nat
```

This update used to fail because `foo` would incorrectly print with a `use bar baz` statement, which caused references
to `bar.baz` to be captured by its locally-bound `baz`.

``` ucm
scratch/main> update

  Okay, I'm searching the branch for code that needs to be
  updated...

  That's done. Now I'm making sure everything typechecks...

  Everything typechecks, so I'm saving the results...

  Done.

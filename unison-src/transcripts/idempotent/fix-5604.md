``` ucm
scratch/main> builtins.mergeio lib.builtin

  Done.
```

The situation:

  - topic has two names for a thing (foo and lib.bar)
  - main delete one alias (foo, leaving lib.bar)
  - When merging topic into main, for some reason we render topic's stuff that depends on that thing as referring to
    `foo`, which main deleted\!

``` ucm
scratch/main> alias.type lib.builtin.Nat MyNat

  Done.
```

``` unison
foo : Nat
foo = 17
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm
  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      foo : MyNat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    foo : MyNat

scratch/main> branch topic

  Done. I've created the topic branch based off of main.

  Tip: To merge your work back into the main branch, first
       `switch /main` then `merge /topic`.

scratch/topic> switch /main

scratch/main> delete.type MyNat

  Done.
```

``` unison
foo : Nat
foo = 18
```

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your
      new definition:
    
      foo : Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> update

  Okay, I'm searching the branch for code that needs to be
  updated...

  Done.

scratch/main> switch /topic
```

``` unison
bar : MyNat
bar = foo + foo
```

This merge used to fail because it rendered `bar` using the deleted name `MyNat` (rather than the still-existing name
`Nat`).

``` ucm
scratch/main> merge /topic

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      bar : Nat
      foo : Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    bar : Nat
    foo : Nat

scratch/main> view bar

  bar : Nat
  bar =
    foo _ =
      _ = foo
      .foo
    foo()
```

# Issue 2

  Done.

    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your
      new definition:
    
      bar : Nat
      foo : Nat
```

Previously, `bar` would incorrectly print with a `foo = foo` line. Now, it works.

``` ucm
scratch/main> update

  Okay, I'm searching the branch for code that needs to be
  updated...

  That's done. Now I'm making sure everything typechecks...

  Everything typechecks, so I'm saving the results...

  Done.

scratch/main> view bar

  bar : Nat
  bar =
    foo = .foo
    foo
```

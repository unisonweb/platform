# Issue 1

``` ucm

  Done.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:

      bar : Nat
      foo : Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    bar : Nat
    foo : Nat

scratch/main> view bar

  bar : Nat
  bar =
    foo1 _ =
      _ = foo
      foo

# Issue 2

  Done.

  change:

    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your
      new definition:

      bar : Nat
      foo : Nat
```

This should succeed, but `bar` gets printed incorrectly\!

``` ucm :error
scratch/main> update

  Okay, I'm searching the branch for code that needs to be
  updated...

  That's done. Now I'm making sure everything typechecks...

  Typechecking failed. I've updated your scratch file with the
  definitions that need fixing. Once the file is compiling, try
  `update` again.
```

``` unison :added-by-ucm scratch.u
foo : Nat
foo = 18

bar : Nat
bar =
  foo = foo
  foo

-- The definitions below no longer typecheck with the changes above.
-- Please fix the errors and try `update` again.

baz : Nat
baz =
  use Nat +
  foo + foo

```

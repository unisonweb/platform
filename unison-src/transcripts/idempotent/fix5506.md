  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      printLine : Text ->{IO, Exception} ()
      putText   : Handle -> Text ->{IO, Exception} ()
      stdOut    : Handle
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> update

  Okay, I'm searching the branch for code that needs to be
  updated...

  Done.

Previously `delete.namespace` would refuse to delete a namespace if it would leave any nameless references in `lib`.

``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> builtins.merge lib.builtin
```

``` unison
lib.one.foo = 17
lib.two.bar = foo Nat.+ foo
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm
  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      lib.one.foo : Nat
      lib.two.bar : Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    lib.one.foo : Nat
    lib.two.bar : Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> delete.namespace lib.one

  Done.
```

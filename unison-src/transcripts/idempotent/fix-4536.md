``` ucm
scratch/main> builtins.merge lib.builtin

  Done.
```

``` unison :error
foo : Nat
foo =
  use Nat .+
  1 + 2
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm
  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:

      3 |   use Nat .+


  I was surprised to find a '.' here.
  I was expecting one of these instead:

  * bang
  * binding
  * do
  * false
  * force
  * handle
  * if
  * lambda
  * let
  * newline or semicolon
  * pattern
  * quote
  * termLink
  * true
  * tuple
  * typeLink
```

``` unison :error
namespace .foo
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm
  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:

      1 | namespace .foo


  I was surprised to find a .foo here.
```

``` unison :error
unique[.foo] type Foo = Foo
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm
  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:

      1 | unique[.foo] type Foo = Foo


  I was surprised to find a .foo here.
```

``` unison :error
.foo> 17
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm
  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  This looks like the start of an expression here 

      1 | .foo> 17

  but at the file top-level, I expect one of the following:

    - A binding, like .foo = 42 OR
                      .foo : Nat
                      .foo = 42
    - A watch expression, like > .foo + 1
    - An `ability` declaration, like unique ability Foo where ...
    - A `type` declaration, like structural type Optional a = None | Some a
```

``` unison :error
foo.> 17
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm
  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:

      1 | foo.> 17


  I was surprised to find a foo.> here.
  I was expecting one of these instead:

  * ability
  * bang
  * binding
  * do
  * false
  * force
  * handle
  * if
  * lambda
  * let
  * namespace
  * newline or semicolon
  * quote
  * termLink
  * true
  * tuple
  * type
  * typeLink
  * use
```

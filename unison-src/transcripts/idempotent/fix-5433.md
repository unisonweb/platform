This used to cause a "duplicate effects" error because we weren't de-duping ability lists after binding names.

``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> builtins.merge lib.builtin
```

``` unison
ability foo.Bar where
  baz : ()
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm
  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      ability foo.Bar
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    ability foo.Bar
```

``` unison
ability foo.Bar where
  baz : '{Bar} ()

hello : Request {foo.Bar} a -> ()
hello = cases
  { baz _ -> _ } -> ()
  { _ } -> ()
```

    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your

Tests a problem with kind checking with data declarations in a file
that refer to types only in the codebase.

``` unison

type T1 = T1C
type T2 = T2C

```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm
  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      type T1
      type T2
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    type T1
    type T2
```

U referring to T from the codebase would cause an error that T could
not be looked up when kind checking U. Essentially, only
dependencies from the combinator being `run` were fetched from the
codebase, but data decls were left in the unisonfile, and needed to
be kind checked.

``` unison

type U = UT T1

ability V where
  veff : T2 -> ()

bomb = do
  _ = 1
  ()
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm
  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      type U
      ability V
      bomb : '()
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> run bomb

  ()
```

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      bar    : Nat
      foo    : Nat
      mytest : [Result]
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    bar    : Nat
    foo    : Nat
    mytest : [Result]

scratch/main> edit.new foo bar

  ☝️

  I added 2 definitions to the top of scratch.u

  You can edit them there, then run `update` to replace the
  definitions currently in this namespace.

scratch/main> edit.new mytest

  ☝️

  I added 1 definitions to the top of scratch.u

  You can edit them there, then run `update` to replace the
  definitions currently in this namespace.

```

``` unison :added-by-ucm scratch.u

  ⚠️

  The following names were not found in the codebase. Check your spelling.
    missing
```

``` ucm :hide

# `edit`

The `edit` command adds to the current fold, and takes care not to add definitions that are already in the file.

``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> builtins.mergeio lib.builtin
```

This stanza does nothing for some reason (transcript runner bug?), so we repeat it twice.

``` unison
foo = 17
bar = 18
baz = 19
```

``` unison
foo = 17
bar = 18

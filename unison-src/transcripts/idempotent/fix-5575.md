``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> builtins.merge lib.builtin
```

A first `:error` block works as expected.

``` unison :error
foo : Nat
foo =
  1 +
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm
  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:

      4 | 

  I was surprised to find an end of section here.
  I was expecting one of these instead:

  * bang
  * do
  * false
  * force
  * handle
  * if
  * let
  * newline or semicolon
  * quote
  * termLink
  * true
  * tuple
  * typeLink
```

But later blocks all act as if they have errors, even if they don’t.

``` unison :bug
foo : Nat
foo =
  1 + 2
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm
  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      foo : Nat
```

But an intervening `ucm` block (regardless of whether it errors) will correct it.

``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> help
```

``` unison
foo : Nat
foo =
  1 + 2
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm
  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

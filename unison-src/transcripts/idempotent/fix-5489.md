  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      type foo.Foo
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    type foo.Foo
```

``` unison
namespace foo
type Foo = Foo
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm
  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked the definitions in scratch.u. This
  file has been previously added to the codebase.

The original bug report identified the mishandling of this simple case involving shadowing, in which we previously
erroneously rendered "bar" with a leading dot.

``` ucm
scratch/main> builtins.merge lib.builtin

  Done.
```

``` unison
foo =
  bar =
    match 5 with
      1 -> 2
      bar -> bar
  bar
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm
  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      foo : Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    foo : Nat

scratch/main> view foo

  foo : Nat
  foo =
    bar = match 5 with
      1   -> 2
      bar -> bar
    bar
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> project.delete scratch
```

There's a more complicated case that was also previously mishandled, though, which involves a top-level binding to which
for which we do need to add a leading dot in order to refer to.

``` ucm
scratch/main> builtins.merge lib.builtin

  Done.
```

``` unison
foo =
  bar =
    match 5 with
      1 -> 2
      bar -> bar + .bar
  bar

bar = 17
```

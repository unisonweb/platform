This should not typecheck - the inline `@eval` expression uses abilities.

``` unison
structural ability Abort where abort : x

ex = {{ @eval{abort} }}
```

``` ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  The expression in red needs the {Abort} ability, but this location does not have access to any abilities.
  
      3 | ex = {{ @eval{abort} }}
  

```
This file should also not typecheck - it has a triple backticks block that uses abilities.

``` ucm
scratch/main> load unison-src/transcripts/fix2238.u

  Loading changes detected in unison-src/transcripts/fix2238.u.

  The expression in red needs the {Abort} ability, but this location does not have access to any abilities.
  
      7 | abort + 1
  

```

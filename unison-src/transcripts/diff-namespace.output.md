Things we want to test:

* Diffing identical namespaces
* Adds, removes, updates (with and without metadata updates)
  * Adds with multiple names
  * Adds with multiple names and different metadata on each
* Moved and copied definitions
  * Moves that have more that 1 initial or final name
* ... terms and types
* New patches, modified patches, deleted patches, moved patches
* With and without propagated updates

## Display issues to fixup

- [d] Do we want to surface new edit conflicts in patches?
- [t] two different auto-propagated changes creating a name conflict should show
      up somewhere besides the auto-propagate count
- [t] Things look screwy when the type signature doesn't fit and has to get broken
      up into multiple lines. Maybe just disallow that?
- [d] Delete blank line in between copies / renames entries if all entries are 1 to 1
      see todo in the code
- [x] incorrectly calculated bracket alignment on hashqualified "Name changes"  (delete.output.md)
- [x] just handle deletion of isPropagated in propagate function, leave HandleInput alone (assuming this does the trick)
- [x] might want unqualified names to be qualified sometimes:
- [x] if a name is updated to a not-yet-named reference, it's shown as both an update and an add
- [x] similarly, if a conflicted name is resolved by deleting the last name to
      a reference, I (arya) suspect it will show up as a Remove
- [d] Maybe group and/or add headings to the types, constructors, terms
- [x] check whether creating a name conflict + adding metadata puts the update
      in both categories; if it does, then filter out metadataUpdates from the
      other categories
- [x] add tagging of propagated updates to test propagated updates output
- [x] missing old names in deletion ppe (delete.output.md)  (superseded by \#1143)
- [x] delete.term has some bonkers output
- [x] Make a decision about how we want to show constructors in the diff
- [x] When you delete a name with metadata, it also shows up in updates section
      with the deleted metadata.
- [x] An add with new metadata is getting characterized as an update
- [x] can there be a metadata-only update where it's not a singleton old and new reference
- [x] 12.patch patch needs a space
- [x] This looks like garbage
- [x] Extra 2 blank lines at the end of the add section
- [x] Fix alignment issues with buildTable, convert to column3M (to be written)
- [x] adding an alias is showing up as an Add and a Copy; should just show as Copy
- [x] removing one of multiple aliases appears in removes + moves + copies section
- [x] some overlapping cases between Moves and Copies^
- [x] Maybe don't list the type signature twice for aliases?

# Test that the options selector for fuzzy finding is working as expected for different argument types.

If an argument is required but doesn't have a fuzzy resolver, the command should just print the help.


```ucm:error
-- The second argument of move.term is a 'new-name' and doesn't have a fuzzy resolver
scratch/main> move.term
```

If a fuzzy resolver doesn't have any options available it should print a message instead of
opening an empty fuzzy-select.

```ucm:error
scratch/empty> view
```


```unison:hide
optionOne = 1

nested.optionTwo = 2
```

```ucm:hide
scratch/main> builtins.mergeio
```

This should not typecheck - the inline `@eval` expression uses abilities.

```unison:error
structural ability Abort where abort : x

ex = {{ @eval{abort} }}
```

This file should also not typecheck - it has a triple backticks block that uses abilities.

```ucm:error
scratch/main> load unison-src/transcripts/fix2238.u
```

Implementation of the Unison distributed programming API.

    data Node
    data Local a

    data Remote a
    at : Node -> a -> Remote a
    instance Monad Remote

    instance Monad Local
    fork : Remote a -> Remote ()
    local : Local a -> Remote a

    root : Node -> Channel Packet
    packet : Remote a -> Packet

`Local` is roughly `IO`, the type of local effects, but has
a few additional functions:

    channel : Local (Channel a)
    send : a -> Channel a -> Local ()
    -- | Registers a callback in a map as a weak ref that sets an MVar
    -- if weak ref becomes garbage, remove from the map
    receiveAsync : Channel a -> Local (Local a)
    -- Can be done a bit more efficiently perhaps
    recieve : Channel a -> Local a
    awaitAsync : Remote a -> Local (Local a)
    await : Remote a -> Local a

For the implementation, a remote computation consists of a step, which evaluates
locally or transfers control to another node, or a step along with a continuation
when the step's result is available. Conceptually represented by the following Haskell type:

    data Remote r
      = Step r
      | forall x . Bind (Step x) (x -> Remote r)

    data Step r = Local r | At Node r

Since this data type would not be serializable as a Haskell
data type (would require serializing arbitrary functions), both
`Local` and the `x -> Remote r` are represented as _Unison_
terms, giving the type:

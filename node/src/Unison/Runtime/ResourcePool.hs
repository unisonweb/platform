-- | `acquire` returns the resource, and the cleanup action ("finalizer") for that resource
data ResourcePool p r = ResourcePool { acquire :: p -> IO (r, IO ()) }

{-
The `ResourcePool p r` is backed by a mutable `Map p (RecycleQueue r)`.
The `RecycleQueue r` is a queue of resources that have been logically
'released' but are available for recycling. After their expiration, a
separate 'reaper thread' will remove them from the queue.

The basic logic for `acquire` is:

1.  Try to obtain a recycled resource for the requested key.
2a. If that succeeds, the resource is taken from the recycle queue,
    preventing multiple threads from accessing the same resource.
2b. If that fails, acquire a fresh resource.
3.  The returned finalizer just adds an entry to the recycle queue,
    for the recycled or newly acquired resource

Thus, multiple resources may be acquired for the same key simultaneously,
and these resources will be recycled if another acquisition occurs before
expiration.
